Hi all\
The club and senior coaches met Thursday to go through a plan going forward\
We have come up with some ideas that will be presented to the league.\
Until we hear their response we will take the next 3 weeks off leading up to Easter.\
As the season has been postponed, not cancelled- we would like you to keep your fitness up over this 3 week period.\
We will keep you all informed and updated as things transpire.\
We want and need this group to stick together, both on and off the field, in these tough times.\
If you have any questions or need a chat about anything, please contact Cobber, Dicko or myself

Cheers\
Critter
