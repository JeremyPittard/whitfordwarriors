The West Australian Football Commission, as part of a national working group including the AFL and other State football bodies, is continuing to discuss the timeline for community football to recommence in Western Australia. While our State Government’s recent decision to ease social distancing restrictions to gatherings of up to 10 people is an encouraging sign in WA, it is important to note that community football remains postponed until May 31st. This includes training sessions at football clubs.
Players are encouraged to continue training away from their club, while ensuring they follow the Government’s current social distancing guidelines. Please keep being patient and do not return to your football club at this point in time.
The State Government, healthcare workers and everyone involved with football in WA have done such a great job preventing the spread of Covid-19 and this needs to continue to ensure we can safely return to training and then games when the time is right. We will continue taking advice from all levels of Government and medical experts so that this is done with the safety of all players, coaches, umpires, staff and volunteers as the absolute priority.
We certainly haven’t given up on this season and, along with all participants and fans, are excited for footy to start again as soon as possible in a safe environment that meets the Government’s guidelines. We will be ready to go when the green light is given, knowing that footy will play a huge part in reconnecting communities right across WA.
We sincerely thank everyone for their patience and understanding as we work through this process and will provide further updates as soon as possible.
Please look after yourselves, your family and teammates. We look forward to seeing everyone back at the footy.
Sincerely,
Gavin Taylor             Wayne Martin
WAFC CEO              AFC Chairman
