Established in 1975 the Whitford Amateur Football Club has enjoyed strong on and off field
success in the north coastal suburbs. We are a proud family club with strong values.
Based out of MacDonald Reserve, we currently have four senior and two colt football teams.
This has proven to be a successful pathway for junior players migrating into our senior
football program with multiple players and coaches alike making their way to WAFL and AFL
levels.

In 2013 we established a netball division, which currently has six teams competing in the
local league. This has built year on year and continues to get stronger with every season.
We are excited to announce that for the 2021 season we will be introducing a senior
women’s football team into the Perth Football League competition.
Are you willing to take on an exciting new challenge for our Club in the Perth Football
League?

We seek an enthusiastic individual to join our family as our first women’s football coach in
our long and proud history.
Like all new ventures, we are looking to establish a strong leadership group, and this begins
with the head coach.

Begin, or extend your coaching journey in our football program at our proud club and
continually strive for success. You will be strongly supported by a well organised and
experienced committee and Senior Coaching Staff.
