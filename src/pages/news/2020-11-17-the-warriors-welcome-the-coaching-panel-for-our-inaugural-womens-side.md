Growing up in Tasmania, footy has always been a part of Brett's life. After a season away from the game, Brett can't wait to get started coaching our inaugural women's team in 2021. Brett's oldest son plays in our colts side.

Katie has a long history in women's football and was instrumental in setting up the Women's competition in Geraldton before relocating to Perth. Katie most recently played for Kingsley in their inaugural team. The blue and white stripes of Whitford are not foreign to Katie who's kids play juniors for Whitfords.

Martin grew up in country Victoria and played most of his senior footy in Vic, having a short stint in South Australia before settling in Perth in 1994. Martin has  a long coaching career starting in the juniors before coaching in the amateurs. Martin then became part of the coaching panel of Kingsley's first female side in 2018. Martin has spent the last few seasons down at MacDonald Reserve watching his daughters partner playing for the mighty Warriors.
