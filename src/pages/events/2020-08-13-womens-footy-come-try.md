Following on from our successful first come and try session we will be holding further sessions on the 19th and 26th of August at the Home of Whitford Football.

The Whitford Amateur Football Club is heading towards the launch of our inaugural Women’s side in 2021, we will be holding a series of ‘Come & Try’ sessions on the 12th, 19th and 26th of August.

The sessions will run from 5.00 – 6.00pm at MacDonald Reserve, Padbury and is open to any ladies who are interested in playing footy whether you have played before or are new to the game. If this sounds like something you, your friends or someone you know would be keen to try, please head down to MacDonald Reserve on the relevant nights.

The focus of the nights will be having fun, getting fit, meeting new people and getting involved in your local community club.\
