  Australian Physiotherapy Equipment (APE) is owned and operated by Sports
  Physiotherapists with over 25 years of experience treating patients in the
  clinic and working with athletes in the sporting arena.


  We therefore understand the needs of the the clinician and the needs of the individual when it comes to Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation Supplies.


  We can offer professional advice, not only to the clinician, but to anyone in the market for Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation Products. No order is too small or too large.


  Service is a corner stone at APE. We offer a prompt and efficient service and we will go out of our way to fill your requirements. If you do not see a product that you require please contact us. We are able to source any specific product that you require. If an order is required urgently we can arrange overnight or same day delivery, however extra freighting charges may apply.


  We realise communication is a key to providing a quality service, so we are always contactable to answer your queries.


  Our aim at APE is to provide an efficient, professional service and excellent value on the biggest range of Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation products.
